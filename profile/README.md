## What is Mame32?

MAME is a multi-purpose emulation framework.

MAME aims to preserve decades of software history. As electronic technology continues to advance rapidly, MAME prevents this important "vintage" software from being lost and forgotten. It does this by documenting the hardware and how it works. MAME's source code serves as that documentation. The fact that the software is usable essentially validates the accuracy of the documentation (and how can you prove that you faithfully recreated the hardware?). Over time, MAME (originally standing for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) absorbed its sister project MESS (Multi Emulator Super System), so MAME now documents a variety of (mostly vintage) computers, video game consoles, and calculators in addition to arcade video games.
